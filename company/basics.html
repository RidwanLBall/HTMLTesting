    <h2>First things first...</h2>
    <p>I need to learn web development.</p>
<hr>
    <h3>What will I do...</h3>
    <p>Here's a todo list.
        <ol>
        <li>Think of a Project</li>
        <li>Find out what languages to start learning...</li>
        <li>Learn HTML and make basic structure.</li>
        <li>Learn CSS and start styling the first few demo pages.</li>
        <li>Have a psychotic break because you cannot find the "[" that you are missing.</li>
        <li>Learn how to use git and version control</li>
        <li>Learn JS for interactivity</li>
        <li>Learn some backend in the form of PHP</li>
        <li>[TBD]</li>
        <li>[TBD]</li>

    <h3>What is the goal for the project</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>To make a cloud storage service with a focus on aesthetically pleasing design and interactivity.
        <br>Ultimately, this project will allow cloud storage of documents, videos, images, and all sorts, with the ability to view it in a very pleasing way. It should function as a second, more powerful and enjoyable to use File Explorer for your content.</li>
    <li>Next Goal thing FUCK argh</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Problems I forsee in the project</h3>
        <dl>
            <dt>Mental Health</dt>
            <dd>I might lose my slowly loosing and slipping grip upon reality and fall irreperably into the freeing abyss of insanity, and I will not only survive but thrive with my new unchained nature</dd>

            <dt>Physical Health</dt>
            <dd>I have less time to work towards my physical health</dd>

            <dt>Spiritual health</dt>
            <dd>It's harder to learn and retain new knowledge, and thus learn to web develop while under the influence of alcohol or narcotics. Thus my spiritual health may suffer greatly.</dd>
